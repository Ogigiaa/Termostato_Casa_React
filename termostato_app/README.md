# Progetto per un termostato domotica sviluppato in React.js (Frontend) e Python v3.10

Per quanto riguarda il frontend l'unico framework utilizzato è appunto React nrll'ultima versione lts
per poter utilizzare React( vi sono più sotto i comandi di inizializzazione) 
è necessario avere anche Node.js installato (versione utilizzata 16.4 lts).
Per il backend ho sviluppato un piccolo sistema crud utilizzando come framework Flask e CORN,
le informazioni sono salvate su di un database in locale Redis creato e messo in funzione tramite Docker
(qualora lo si volesse provare ricordare di cambiare l'indirizzo e la password di accesso al db con le vostre che  avete)
Vi sono anche le stesse crud (sotto commento però) utilizzando MongoDB sempre virtualizzato ed utilizzato tramite Docker
Per il backend è stato creato un virtualenv da PyCharm adatto 

Buona visione ed utilizzo

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
